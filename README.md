# WTEitR-Gephi-Plugins
"Wrangling The Elephant in the Room" is a collaborative research project aimed at the development of techniques for the visual analysis of graph data. Our initial efforts included the development of a dashboard prototype, focused on the effect of pre-attentive attributes in the representation of complex graph data. We were not concerned with providing the best visualization techiques for specific graph properties, as is common in graph visualization research. Rather, we focused our initial efforts on pairing statistical visualization techniques with common graph algorithmics.

Each component of the dashboard was written as a plugin for Gephi open graph visualization platform. Tragically, the platform does not yet support any releases past JAVA 6, though future changes have been rumored. My contributions to this project included the development of these plugins, as well as the construction of new ideas for analysis. Contained within this repository is one of the simpler plugins my research constructed. The purpose of this plugin is to generate a histogram of all-pairs-shortest-path distances, using the commonly known Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
